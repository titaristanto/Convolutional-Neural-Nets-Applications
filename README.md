# Convolutional Neural Networks Applications
This is a collection of some classical and CNN algorithm implementations:
1. CIFAR Digit Classification using SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors and a Simple Fully-connected Neural Networks
2. Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Fully Neural Networks and Batch Norm from scratch for Image Classification
3. LSTM and Vanilla RNN for Captioning, GAN for Digit Image Generation, Style Transfer Application in Paitings and Network Visualization using Saliency Map
